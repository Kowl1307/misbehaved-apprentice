This is a university game project

## Overview of Game Idea

We're doing a metroidvania style game in which you can transform into different transformations.
You'll have acess to the following transformations:
- Human
    - You can walk, jump and sprint
- Ball
    - You can bounce against walls and floors
- Spike
    - You can stick to solid objects
    - You can stick to a conveyor belt which moves you along it
- Slime
    - You can move through pipes
    - You can kill your momentum on impact

There will be enemies walking around that you can fight using the transformations. There will also be platforming challenges and puzzles where you need to find out the order of transformations to clear a gap or be precise in how you move with the transformations.

## What can you do in the alpha?

You can play a test level in which you can transform into the different transformations described above.

Once you start the game, you'll be in Human form and can walk around. There are some tutorial / hint texts in the background to guide you through the test level.

Controls:
- Switch Tranasformations:
    - On Keyboard press 1,2 or 3 (above wasd)
    - On Controller press x,y or b (or square, triangle or circle respectively)
- Human:
    - Walk:
        - Keyboard: A and D
        - Controller: Left joystick
    - Jump
        - Keyboard: Spacebar
        - Controller: A button (or X)
    - Sprint (press while walking):
        - Keyboard: left shift
        - Controller: Right shoulder (the lower one)
- Ball
    - Press Jump button to give a small acceleration boost
- Spike
    - Press jump to transform into Human and perform a walljump (if you're stuck in a wall)
- Slime
    - Move slightly by pressing left/right as for walking
    - Stand above a pipe entrance, then you can use wasd or left joystick to move through the pipe

## What does **not** work in the alpha?

- Slime transformation (partially)
    - We're unsure where to go with this transformation as it is quite similar to the spike (as in killing momentum). We are planning on using the slime as defensive option in combat with enemies, which would be a standout to the other transformations which do not give a defensive option.
    - There's also a bug where you can use the slime to fly around as you wish :)
- We know that the spike in combination with the pendulum does not feel good at the moment. We added it as a proof of concept for now. You can still give feedback to it though!
- You can get infinite speed by holding down the jump button while in ball form

## What feedback do we want to get?
- How is the general feel of the transformations? Does something feel off? (For example the ball feels to heavy/light)
- Do you have ideas for what the slime could be used?
- Do you see enough? Is the camera too close etc.?
